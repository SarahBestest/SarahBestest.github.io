# EO3R Skill Simulator

A skill simulator for Etrian Odyssey III R, a mod for EO3 which revamps most of the game, including:

* 3DS-era dungeon movement speed.
* Every class is changed, sometimes dramatically (Yggdroid in particular is a totally new class).
* Almost every monster has been rebalanced.
* Ailments are more useful.
* Rare breeds are implemented.
* Gathering has been changed to be somewhat of a hybrid between EO3 style and the 3DS games.
* You can control guest characters in Sea Quest battles.
* Petrify is changed to work like EO5+.
* All classes are unlocked from the start.
* Damage cap increased to 99999.
* Ally HP cap of 999 is removed.
* Curse is also reworked to significantly lower LUC, and is at the bottom of ailment hierarchy.
* Some Limit skills are reworked.
* Damage formula was reworked; armor is worth more than before, for example.
* Retire is removed. Stat gain and SP gain (post-level 70) are adjusted to compensate for the lack of retire. Total SP is same in EO3R as 99R99.
* EXP curve is also adjusted to reduce excessive leveling. Certain post-game enemies were strengthened to compensate for this as well.
* Charge effects are shown (by change in name colour)
* Able to see buffs/debuffs on the enemy (press Y twice; once to see buffs on the ally, and once more for the enemy).
